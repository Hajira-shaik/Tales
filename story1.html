       <p class="a"><i>Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were falling like feathers
        from the sky, a queen sat at a window sewing, and the frame of the window was made of black
        ebony. And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow, she pricked
        her finger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. And the red looked
        pretty upon the white snow, and she thought to herself, would that I had a child as white as
        snow, with lips as red as blood, and hair as black as the wood of the window-frame.
        Soon after that she had a little daughter, who was as white as snow, her lips were as red
        as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony, and she was therefore called little snow-white.
        And when the child was born, the queen died.</i></p>

        <p><i>After a year had passed the king took to himself another wife. She was a beautiful woman,
            but proud and haughty, and she could not bear that anyone else should surpass her in beauty.
            She had a wonderful looking-glass, and when she stood in front of it and looked at herself in
            it, and said,“looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall, who in this land is the fairest of all.”
            The looking-glass answered,
            <br>“thou, o queen, art the fairest of all.”
            Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the looking-glass spoke the truth.
            But snow-white was growing up, and grew more and more beautiful, and when she was seven
            years old she was as beautiful as the day, and more beautiful than the queen herself. And
            once when the queen asked her looking-glass,
            “looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall, who in this land is the fairest of all.”
            It answered,
                  “thou art fairer than all who are here, lady queen. But more beautiful still is snow-white is leen.<br>Then the queen was shocked, and turned yellow and green with envy. From that hour,
            whenever she looked at snow-white, her heart heaved in her breast, she hated the girl so
            much. And envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed, so that she had
            no peace day or night. She called a huntsman, and said, take the child away into the forest.
            I will no longer have her in my sight. Kill her, and bring me back her lung and liver as a
            token. The huntsman obeyed, and took her away but when he had drawn his knife, and was
            about to pierce snow-white’s innocent heart, she began to weep, and said, ah dear huntsman,
            leave me my life. I will run away into the wild forest, and never come home again.

            <center><img src="./2.jpeg.jpeg" alt="" height="200" width="700" class="img-sty"></center>
            <p class="a">One morning, the Mirror tells the Queen that there is a maiden fairer than she: Snow White. Meanwhile, Snow White is in the courtyard, singing I'm Wishing to herself as she works. The Prince, riding by the castle, hears her voice and is enchanted by it. He climbs over the castle wall, unseen by Snow White, who is singing to her reflection at the bottom of the wishing well, which is in the middle of the courtyard. The Prince joins in the singing, taking Snow White by surprise; she runs indoors, but when he pleads for her to return she comes to the balcony and listens as he sings One Song to her. Unseen by both, the Queen watches from her window high above. Infuriated at Snow White's beauty (and perhaps jealous for the Prince's affections), she closes the curtains. The Prince blows Snow White a kiss before leaving.</p>
            <h2><i><b>The Forest....</b></i></h2><hr><br>
            <img src="./for.jpeg" align="right" heigh="300" width="200" class="image-style" >
            <p class="a">The Queen summons the Huntsman, whom she orders to take Snow White to a secluded glade in the forest and, there, kill her; she demands the girl's heart as proof. The Huntsman is reluctant to do so, but is bound by his orders; he takes Snow White deep into the forest, where he lets her gather wildflowers. As Snow White helps a baby bird find its parents, the Huntsman unsheaths his dagger and advances on the princess. When Snow White sees him approaching, she screams; however, Humbert is unable to fulfill his orders and, shaking, drops his dagger. Taking pity on Snow White, he begs her for forgiveness and, warning her of the Queen's intentions, pleads that she run far away. As Snow White flees through the forest, her fear manifests itself in what she sees around her; eventually, she falls to the ground in fright. She is befriended by the animals of the forest; she sings With a Smile and a Song and asks them if they know of a place she can stay.But now the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and so terrified that she looked at all
                the leaves on the trees, and did not know what to do. Then she began to run, and ran over
                sharp stones and through thorns, and the wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm.
                She ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening, then she saw a little cottage
                and went into it to rest herself. Everything in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner
                than can be told. There was a table on which was a white cover, and seven little plates,
                and on each plate a little spoon, moreover, there were seven little knives and forks, and seven
                little mugs. Against the wall stood seven little beds side by side, and covered with snow-white
                counterpanes.</p>
                <h2><i><b>The Cottage of the Seven Dwarfs....</b></i></h2><hr><br>
                
                    <center><img src="./5.jpeg.jpeg" alt="" aling="left" height="300" width="200" class="img-sty" ></center>
                    <p class="a">The animals lead her to the Cottage of the Seven Dwarfs, which she finds empty and dirty. Thinking that cleaning the house may persuade the cottage's owners to let her stay, Snow White and the animals clean the cottage and its contents while singing Whistle While You Work. The seven dwarfs, meanwhile, are working in their mine, digging for diamonds. When it is time for them to go home for the day, they march through the forest, singing Heigh-Ho. After cleaning the house, Snow White falls asleep on several of the dwarfs' beds. When the dwarfs see light coming from the cottage, they approach cautiously, thinking that a monster has taken up residence in their home. They search the ground floor of the house, but are afraid to go upstairs. After an unsuccessful attempt by Dopey to chase the 'monster' down, all seven dwarfs venture upstairs to discover Snow White asleep. She wakes up and guesses the name of each dwarf. They allow her to stay (though Grumpy is reluctant). Snow White remembers that she has left soup downstairs and rushes downstairs to prepare it, ordering the dwarfs to wash while they wait. The dwarfs proceed outside to a trough, where all but Grumpy wash; the six other dwarfs later wash Grumpy, dumping him into the trough when supper is ready.</p>
                        <center><img src="./9.jpeg.jpeg" alt="" aling="left" height="300" width="200" class="img-sty" ></center>
                 <p class="a">Little snow-white was so hungry and thirsty that she ate some vegetables and bread from
                    each plate and drank a drop of wine out of each mug, for she did not wish to take all from one
                    only. Then, as she was so tired, she laid herself down on one of the little beds, but none of
                    them suited her, one was too long, another too short, but at last she found that the seventh
                    one was right, and so she remained in it, said a prayer and went to sleep.

                <h2><i><b>The Heart of a pig....</b></i></h2><hr><br>
                <p class="a">That evening, Grimhilde once again consults the Magic Mirror, who tells her that Snow White still lives; the Huntsman has given her a pig's heart. Furious, She descends a spiral staircase, entering her dungeon, where she resolves to do away with the princess herself. She used a potion to transform herself from a young queen to an old and ugly witch-like peddler - a disguise to deceive Snow White. She then decides to use a Poisoned Apple to send Snow White into the Sleeping Death (a magically-induced coma). At the cottage, the dwarfs perform The Silly Song to entertain Snow White. She then sings Someday My Prince Will Come (referring to her romance with the Prince) before sending them up to bed; however, Doc orders the dwarfs to sleep downstairs, allowing Snow White to sleep in their beds upstairs. Meanwhile, the Witch prepares the poisoned apple and, dismissing the possibility that Snow White may be revived by 'love's first kiss' (the only cure for the Sleeping Death), gleefully proclaims that Snow White will appear dead and will be 'buried alive'. She leaves the castle and makes her way to the dwarfs' cottage, kicking the skeleton of a long-deceased prisoner on the way out.</p>

                <h2><i><b>The poisoned Aplle....</b></i></h2><hr><br>
                <p class="a">As the dwarfs leave for the mine the next morning, Snow White kisses each dwarf on the forehead; though Grumpy initially resists, Snow White's kiss sends him into a love-struck stupor. He warns her not to let any strangers into the house. After the dwarfs have left the cottage, the Witch takes Snow White by surprise and offers her the poisoned apple,</p>
                <center><img src="./12.jpeg.jpeg" alt="" aling="left" height="300" width="200" class="img-sty" ></center>
            <p class="a">which Snow White is about to bite until the forest animals, sensing danger, try to attack the Witch. This causes Snow White to take pity on the old woman and take her into the cottage for a glass of water. The animals rush to the mine, and tell the dwarfs of the danger. The dwarfs eventually realize what is happening and, led by Grumpy, hurry back to the cottage. The Witch persuades Snow White to take a bite from the apple by telling her that it is a "wishing apple"; after biting the fruit, the Snow White falls into a deep sleep, and the Witch cackles in triumph, proclaiming she's now the fairest in the land. The dwarfs arrive and chase the Witch, eventually cornering her on a rocky cliff, where she attempts to crush them with a boulder but is sent over the cliff by a bolt of lightning. She is devoured (offscreen) by two vultures.</p>

            <h2><i><b>The Funeral....</b></i></h2><hr><br>
            <p class="a">The dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found snow-white lying upon the ground,
                she breathed no longer and was dead. They lifted her up, looked to see whether they could
                find anything poisonous, unlaced her, combed her hair, washed her with water and wine, but
                it was all of no use, the poor child was dead, and remained dead. They laid her upon a bier,
                and all seven of them sat round it and wept for her, and wept three days long.
                </p>
                <center><img src="./15.jpeg" alt="" aling="left" height="300" width="200" class="img-sty" ></center>
                <p class="a">Then they were going to bury her, but she still looked as if she were living, and still had
                    her pretty red cheeks. They said, we could not bury her in the dark ground, and they had a
                    transparent coffin of glass made, so that she could be seen from all sides, and they laid her in
                    it, and wrote her name upon it in golden letters, and that she was a king’s daughter. Then
                    they put the coffin out upon the mountain, and one of them always stayed by it and watched
                    it. And birds came too, and wept for snow-white, first an owl, then a raven, and last a dove.<br>And now snow-white lay a long, long time in the coffin, and she did not change, but looked
                    as if she were asleep, for she was as white as snow, as red as blood, and her hair was as black
                    as ebony.
                    </p>
                    <h2><i><b>The Marriage....</b></i></h2><hr><br>
                    <p class="a">It happened, however, that a king’s son came into the forest, and went to the dwarfs, house
                        to spend the night. He saw the coffin on the mountain, and the beautiful snow-white within
                        it, and read what was written upon it in golden letters. Then he said to the dwarfs, let me
                        have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want for it. But the dwarfs answered, we will
                        not part with it for all the gold in the world. Then he said, let me have it as a gift, for I
                        cannot live without seeing snow-white. I will honor and prize her as my dearest possession.
                        As he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity upon him, and gave him the coffin.
                        And now the king’s son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders.<br> And it
                        happened that they stumbled over a tree-stump, and with the shock the poisonous piece of
                        apple which snow-white had bitten off came out of her throat. And before long she opened her
                        eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin, sat up, and was once more alive. Oh, heavens, where am I,
                        she cried. The king’s son, full of joy, said, you are with me. And told her what had happened,
                        and said, I love you more than everything in the world, come with me to my father’s palace,
                        you shall be my wife.</p>
                        <center><img src="./16.jpeg" alt="" aling="left" height="300" width="200" class="img-sty" ></center>
                        <p class="a">And snow-white was willing, and went with him, and their wedding was held with great show
                            and splendor. But snow-white’s wicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast. When she
                            had arrayed herself in beautiful clothes she went before the looking-glass, and said, lookingglass, looking-glass, on the wall, who in this land is the fairest of all.
                            The glass answered, oh, queen, of all here the fairest art thou, but the young queen is fairer
                            by far as I trow</p>
                            <p class="a">Then the wicked woman uttered a curse, and was so wretched, so utterly wretched that she
                                knew not what to do. At first she would not go to the wedding at all, but she had no peace,
                                and had to go to see the young queen. And when she went in she recognized snow-white, and
                                she stood still with rage and fear, and could not stir. But iron slippers had already been put
                                upon the fire, and they were brought in with tongs, and set before her. Then she was forced
                                to put on the red-hot shoes, and dance until she dropped down dead.
                                </p>
