        <p class="a"><i>Once upon a time, deep under the sea lived a redheaded beautiful young mermaid named Ariel. She was a curious and adventurous little mermaid, who loved exploring her home city of Atlantica with her companions. Some days she wondered what life as a human living on land would be like. Because of her fascination with the human world, she would often swim up to shore with her friend Flounder to find human treasures.</i></p>

      <p class="a">Ariel's father, King Triton, did not trust humans and thought that they were dangerous and unsafe. He did not like Ariel’s trip close to the shore. He found out that she had once again disobeyed him and gone to the shore. He was furious. He banned her from going to the shore ever again and asked a Lobster named Sebastian, who was his greatest advisor, to keep an eye on the rebellious green-tailed mermaid. </p>
<p class="a">Despite her father’s wishes, Ariel continued to go to the shore after tricking Sebastian. One such night, she reached the surface and a terrible storm came. A ship was stuck in this storm and the two friends saw a young prince fall overboard and into the sea.</p>
